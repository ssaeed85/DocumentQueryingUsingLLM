# Document Querying Using Language Model (LLM)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform document querying using a Language Model (LLM). It includes a Jupyter Notebook (`QueryingNotbook.ipynb`) that guides you through the process of using a pre-trained language model for text-based document querying.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch (recommended for running the notebook)
- Transformers library (Hugging Face)

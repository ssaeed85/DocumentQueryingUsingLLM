    "Document parsers are a powerful tool that can help enterprises automate the process of extracting data from documents. This can save a significant amount of time and money, and can also help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of business processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document parsers can be used to extract data from a wide variety of document types, including employee handbooks, catalogs, invoices, purchase orders, sales orders, shipping and delivery orders, form-based contracts, HR and admin documents, bank and credit card statements, fillable PDF forms, and Word documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are particularly powerful for querying against documents because they can understand the context of the documents and can generate responses that are relevant and informative. For example, if you ask an LLM to summarize the main points of a document, it will be able to identify the most important information in the document and present it in a concise and easy-to-understand way.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are still under development, but they have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with documents. LLMs can help us to find information more quickly and easily, understand documents more deeply, and generate new content based on the information in documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise is to try and implement a LLM response to a localized document. In lieu of a personal document that might be parsed against, I have pulled in some open source documents from the fantastic \n",

    "We will try to implement an LLM querying system using natural language prompts to answer using the documents provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "**An Important Note**: Since these are open source documents, the LLM might already be aware of the information, so we will prompt the model to only look at the data provided to the LLM as part of the prompt."

    "Looks like we have our corpus ready which is a list of chunks made from all the documents in our data folder. Now we can pass each and every `chunk` to the `LLM` model and have it answer the question using each chunk as a source. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, he current approach of passing each and every chunk to the `LLM` model has a number of drawbacks. Firstly, it is computationally expensive, as the model has to process a large amount of data. Secondly, it can be time-consuming, as the model has to make a large number of calls to the `LLM` API. Thirdly, it can be inaccurate, as the model may be misled by irrelevant chunks. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more advantageous approach would be to pass only relevant chunks to the LLM model. This would reduce the number of calls to the LLM API, as well as the amount of data that the model has to process, which should lead to a more efficient and cost-effective approach. Additionally, it would improve the accuracy of the model, as the model would not be misled by irrelevant chunks. We can then use the LLM to summarize and give us a final answer based on the answers that it gave for the core *n* chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to find relevant chunks within a corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We could have a `human-in-the-loop` system. In this system, a human would identify the relevant chunks. The identified chunks would then be passed to the LLM model.This is normally the least time efficient solution, even for a marignal sized corpus\n",
    "- One common automated approach is to use `keyword search`. This involves searching the corpus for chunks that contain specific keywords or phrases. For example, if we are interested in finding chunks about the topic of \"natural language processing,\" we could search the corpus for chunks that contain the keywords \"natural language processing,\" \"NLP,\" or \"machine translation.\"\n",
    "- The more modern approach would be to use `embeddings similarity` measures to find relevant chunks within a corpus. Embeddings similarity measures allow us to measure the similarity between two chunks by comparing their embedding vectors. For example, we could use the `cosine similarity` measure to compare the embedding vectors of two words \"king\" and \"emperor\". The cosine similarity measure would return a value between 0 and 1, where a higher value indicates a greater similarity between the two chunks. We can also use `L2` distance as a measure (`euclidean distance`)\n",

      "A: The Castle Dracula is located in the Carpathian mountains and is described as being on the edge of a precipice with a view of green treetops and deep rifts. It is described as having doors everywhere that are locked and bolted, with the only available exits being the windows. The castle is old and big, with broken walls and cold wind. The narrator explores various stairs, passages, and doors, finding one that is not locked. The castle is situated deep under a hill and can be seen in all its grandeur from a distance. The Count of Dracula is seen crawling down the castle wall with his cloak spread out like wings. The narrator also sees what appears to be the evil face of Count Dracula in the shadows of a dark passage. The landlord receives a letter from Count Dracula instructing him to secure the best place on the coach for the narrator, but refuses to provide details or speak about Count Dracula and his castle.\n",
      "Q: Why did Dorian Gray want his portrait made?\n",
      "A: Dorian Gray wanted his portrait made because he was curious about Basil Hallward's refusal to exhibit it, he wanted to capture and preserve his own beauty, he believed the portrait would absorb his whole nature, soul, and art, and he wanted to hide a secret from Basil.\n"
